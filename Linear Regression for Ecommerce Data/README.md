Creates some initial data visualizations with Seaborn to explore relationships.

<b>4-Split dataset.py</b> :
Splits the data into training and test sets.

<b>5-Import, train, test model.py</b> :
Imports LinearRegression, trains the model on the training data, and makes predictions on the test data.

<b>6-X,Y test predict.py</b> :
Evaluates the model by comparing predictions to actual values and calculating MSE and RMSE.
