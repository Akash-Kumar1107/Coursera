3-Graph Plot.py
Creates some initial data visualizations with Seaborn to explore relationships.

4-Split dataset.py
Splits the data into training and test sets.

5-Import, train, test model.py
Imports LinearRegression, trains the model on the training data, and makes predictions on the test data.

6-X,Y test predict.py
Evaluates the model by comparing predictions to actual values and calculating MSE and RMSE.

7-Suggestion.py
Prints and interprets the model coefficients to provide suggestions to the business.
